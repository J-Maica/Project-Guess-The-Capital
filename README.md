# REST APIs

## Overview
- This project is made to practice how to use the Postgres database. The application fetches capital cities from a PostgreSQL database and presents a series of questions to the user. The user can submit their answers, skip questions, and see their total score.
- The project is an educational exercise, originally developed as part of the Udemy course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp." and I just added aditional "skip" function.
